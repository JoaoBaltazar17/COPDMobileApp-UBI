# Mobile Application for COPD

This project aims to develop a mobile application for individuals with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The application is designed to provide functionalities that facilitate disease monitoring and offer support during exacerbations, as well as include physical tests and **patch incorporation** (simulation) for more efficient tracking.

## App Features

The COPD mobile application includes the following key features:

- Disease Monitoring
- Real-time Exacerbation Instructions
-  Physical Tests
-  Patch Incorporation

## Project Folder Structure

The project is organized with the following folder structure:

- **COPDMonitorApp**: This folder contains the code for the COPD mobile application.
- **Documents**: Here, you will find all useful documents created throughout the development process.
- **Sprints**: This folder is dedicated to the work conducted in each sprint of the project, housing files and records related to each stage.

## Getting Started

This application was built and planned in order to incorporate a sensory patch in the future. The application works correctly without this embedding, but with greater inaccuracy in results.

To get started with the COPD Mobile Application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or download the COPDMonitorApp folder** from the project repository.
2. **Set up the development environment** by installing the necessary programming tools, libraries, and dependencies.
3. **Build and deploy the application** on a compatible mobile device or emulator/simulator.
4. **Launch the app** and create a user account or log in if you already have one.
5. **Explore the features** of the app, including disease monitoring, real-time exacerbation instructions, physical tests, and patch incorporation.
6. **Provide feedback** on your experience using the app, including any issues encountered, suggestions for improvements, or additional features you would like to see.
